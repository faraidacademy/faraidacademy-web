DUE DILIGENCE (do these first):

 1. check the current state of the entire project, so that you don't reinvent wheels, and please use DRY principles.
 2. check the current state of the supabase using `supabase` mcp server for the same reason.
 3. refer to relevant documentations (supabase, zod, tailwind css, daisyui) using `context7` mcp server.
 4. USE `Astro docs` MCP server to check for latest best practices for astro, astro supabase, astro actions, astro zod, astro tailwind css.
 5. we also have `netlify` mcp server for netlify related tasks.
 6. you are FREE to use the terminal.
 8. if I give you a link, FETCH IT and read the content.

this project is using npm and astro v5.

then plan carefully.
