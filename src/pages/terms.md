# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** May 22, 2025

Welcome to Faraid Academy! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Faraid Academy website, including all content, features, and services offered (collectively, the "Service"). Faraid Academy is a personal educational project created and operated by Faraid Academy Operator, an individual.

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Service.

**1. About Faraid Academy**

Faraid Academy is an educational platform primarily focused on Islamic inheritance law. It may also host competitions related to its educational content. The Service is a personal project intended for educational purposes.

**2. User Accounts**

*   **Registration:** To access certain features of the Service, such as participating in competitions or saving profile information, you may need to create an account, typically through Google OAuth.
*   **Account Responsibility:** You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.
*   **Accuracy of Information:** You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete.

**3. User Conduct**

You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in a manner that does not infringe the rights of, restrict, or inhibit anyone else's use and enjoyment of the Service. Prohibited behavior includes, but is not limited to:

*   Providing false or misleading information.
*   Harassing, abusing, or harming another person.
*   Attempting to disrupt or interfere with the Service's security or functionality.
*   Using any automated system, such as "bots," "spiders," or "offline readers," to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to our servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional web browser.

**4. Competitions**

*   **Competition Rules:** From time to time, Faraid Academy may host competitions. Each competition will have its own specific rules, guidelines, and eligibility requirements, which will be detailed in a competition guide (e.g., `competition-guide.md`). By participating in a competition, you agree to abide by its specific rules.
*   **Fair Play:** Participants in any Faraid Academy competition are expected to uphold the highest standards of sportsmanship and academic honesty. Cheating, plagiarism, collusion, or any other form of academic dishonesty is strictly prohibited and may result in disqualification and/or account suspension. This is especially critical for timed competitions.
*   **Results:** Competition results, which may include participant names and profile pictures (if `is_visible` is enabled by the user), may be published on the Service.

**5. Intellectual Property**

*   **Our Content:** All content provided on the Service, including text, graphics, logos, icons, images, audio clips, digital downloads, data compilations, software, and competition questions, is the property of Muhammad Siddiq or its content suppliers and protected by international copyright laws. You may not modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any information, software, products, or services obtained from the Service without our prior written consent.
