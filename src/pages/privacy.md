We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.

*   **Profile Information (Optional, user-editable):**
    *   **School/University:** To understand our user base and potentially for display in competition leaderboards.
    *   **Phone Number:** Optional, for contact purposes if needed (e.g., for significant competition matters, though email is primary).
    *   **Gender:** Optional, for demographic understanding or specific competition categories if applicable.
    *   **Visibility Preference :** A boolean flag you set to determine if your name and avatar are displayed publicly in participant lists or competition results.

    *   **User ID:** A unique ID assigned by Supabase upon account creation.

    We do not use cookies for tracking purposes beyond essential authentication and user preferences as described. We do not use third-party analytics cookies.

**2. How We Use Your Information**

We use the collected data for various purposes:

**3. How We Share Your Information**

We do not sell your personal data. We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:

*   **With Service Providers:**
    *   **Supabase:** We use Supabase for database hosting, user authentication, and backend services. Supabase stores your profile data, competition results, and authentication information. Their privacy policy governs their use of data.
    *   **Google (OAuth):** If you sign in using Google, Google shares your email, name, and avatar URL with us as per your Google account permissions.
*   **Competition Results:** If you participate in a competition and have your `is_visible` setting enabled, your name and avatar URL may be displayed in public leaderboards or lists of participants. If `is_visible` is disabled, your identity will not be publicly linked to your results, though your participation will still be recorded for scoring.
*   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
    *   To comply with a legal obligation.
    *   To protect and defend the rights or property of Afif Zaki.
    *   To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service.
    *   To protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public.

If your account is inactive for a period of **one (1) year**, we may delete your account and associated profile data.
*   **Competition Data (Answers & Scores):** Your answers to competition questions and resulting scores linked to your user ID will be retained **indefinitely**. This allows past participants to review their scores and performance. If you request account deletion, we will anonymize this competition data if feasible, or delete it if anonymization is not practical while still preserving the integrity of overall competition statistics.
*   **Local Storage Data:** Data stored in your browser's local storage (theme, prompt dismissal) remains until you clear your browser's cache/data.

**6. Data Security**

The security of your data is important to us. We rely on the security measures implemented by our service provider, Supabase, for data storage and authentication. We also implement "common sense" security practices appropriate for a personal project. However, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**7. Children's Privacy**

Our Service is primarily intended for university students and individuals above high school age. It is not directed to individuals under the age of 16 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 16. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.

**8. International Data Transfers**

Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction. Our service provider, Supabase, utilizes a global infrastructure. If you are located outside Indonesia and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to be processed where Supabase servers are located and in Indonesia where the operator is based. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
